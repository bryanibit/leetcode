## What is it

This is a combination with a number of my answers and my thoughts to these [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset) problems. It is my pleasure to refer to it for every reader.  

## How to use it

Every .py or .cpp file is an answer to one LeetCode problem and combines a *main()* function. For .py, you can run it directly. As for .cpp, you need to add it to Visual Studio Project or write a *CmakeLists.txt* or *Makefile* for it.  
The name of every .py or .cpp file coincides with that in Leetcode. You can search the name in [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset) and see the introductions or requirements about the problem.
